I was fortunate to attend 15th International ERCOFTAC Symposium on Engineering Turbulence Modelling and Measurements (ETMM15) held in Dubrovnik, Croatia this September. 

At the conference, I delivered an oral presentation on my research titled: ‘Development of GANs-Based Wall Model for Large Eddy Simulation of Wall-Bounded Flow.’ Although it was my first international conference, I received diverse and insightful feedback from researchers worldwide, which made the experience extremely valuable. 
You can find the proceedings from the conference here:  👉 [Proceedings link](https://lnkd.in/digZYwpB)

Outside the sessions, I also enjoyed exploring the beautiful old town of Dubrovnik and the summer scenery of the Adriatic Sea, making the trip both academically and personally enriching. I am truly grateful to everyone who supported me and made this opportunity possible. I will continue to dedicate myself to advancing my research.
