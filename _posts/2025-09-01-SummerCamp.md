I had the privilege of joining the Summer Camp 2025 organized by the Graduate Program for Mechanical Systems Innovation (GMSI), the Univesity of Tokyo this July.

This camp brought together PhD students from around the world near Mt. Fuji to tackle the challenge: “A Project of an Innovation Device for Future Factories.”

Our team proposed the Smart 3-in-1 Physical Separation Device, aiming to enable high-precision and rational plastic recycling — rather than relying too easily on the recent trend of AI.

As the technical lead, I focused on building the materials for discussions, concretizing methodologies, and evaluating their feasibility.
In the end, our project was honored with the Best Innovation Prize.

I am deeply grateful to the professors who advised us and to my wonderful teammates — Ting-Wei Chang (Emily), Tapasvi Bhatt, Nadia Oktiarsy, and Zheng Zhou.

Through this experience, I cultivated:
 • Deeper skills in constructive discussions
 • Stronger teamwork capabilities
 • The ability to identify challenges and drive them toward results

This was truly a valuable experience that I am determined to bring back into my future research.
Wishing everyone the very best in their academic journeys — I look forward to the day we meet again!
