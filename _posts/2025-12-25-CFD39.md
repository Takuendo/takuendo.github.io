I am pleased to share that I attend the 39th CFD Symposium in Kita-kyushu on December 16-18, 2025.
The title is
“Application of GAN to Wall-Modeled LES Using Local Flow Information and Its Performance Evaluation”

Many thanks to my collaborators and supervisors for their continued guidance and support.
