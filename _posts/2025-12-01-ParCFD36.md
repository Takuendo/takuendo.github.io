I had the opportunity to give an oral presentation at 36th Parallel CFD international conference 2025 (ParCFD), which took place in Mérida, Mexico, this November. The title of my presentation was “Development of a GANs-Based Wall Model for Large Eddy Simulation Using Local Flow Information.”

It was a valuable experience to engage in discussions with researchers from the HPC community, with whom I don’t often have the chance to interact. The feedback and insights I received were extremely helpful and provided me with new perspectives on my research.

I am grateful to the conference organizers and all participants for the stimulating discussions.
