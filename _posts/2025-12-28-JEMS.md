I am very happy to share that my first journal paper has been published 🎉

Title: Performance Analysis of Interacting Rigid Wind Sails and Rotor Sails by Kriging Surrogate Model
📄 [Journal link](https://jemsjournal.org/articles/performance-analysis-of-interacting-rigid-wind-sails-and-rotor-sails-by-kriging-surrogate-model/jems.2025.26097)

This study examines wind-assisted propulsion as a method to lower CO₂ emissions in the maritime industry. 
Typically, wind-assisted ships use only one type of wind propulsion device. However, each device performs well in certain wind directions and poorly in others, making consistent wind power use challenging. 

To address this issue, we investigated how combining two different wind propulsion devices can reduce fuel consumption. The analysis used a CFD-based surrogate model along with a ship system model, enabling us to assess the effectiveness of this hybrid setup quantitatively. 

This research started as a coursework project during my master’s program at the University of Tokyo and was later expanded into a journal paper. 
I am very grateful to Cem GUZELBULUT for his excellent supervision and valuable contributions to this work. Thank you very much.
