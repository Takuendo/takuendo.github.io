I am honored to share that I have been selected as a doctoral scholarship holder of the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes (German National Academic Foundation).

This prestigious scholarship supports outstanding doctoral researchers in Germany and provides financial assistance, as well as access to a wide range of academic and professional development programs, for at least the next three years.

With this support, I will be able to fully focus on my doctoral research in fluid dynamics and machine learning, while also engaging in interdisciplinary exchange within the Studienstiftung network.

I am deeply grateful to my supervisors, collaborators, and mentors for their guidance and support throughout the application process.

I look forward to continuing my research and making the most of this opportunity.
