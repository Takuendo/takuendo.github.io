I am honored to share that I have been selected as a doctoral scholarship holder of the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes (German National Academic Foundation).<br>
👉 [Scholarship website](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/doctoral-scholarships/doctoral-scholarships)

This prestigious scholarship supports outstanding doctoral researchers in Germany and provides financial assistance, as well as access to a wide range of academic and professional development programs, for at least the next three years.

With this support, I will be able to fully focus on my doctoral research in fluid dynamics and machine learning, while also engaging in interdisciplinary exchange within the Studienstiftung network.

I am deeply grateful to my supervisor, and collaborators for their guidance and support throughout the application process.

I look forward to continuing my research and making the most of this opportunity.
